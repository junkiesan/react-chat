# [Chat Application](https://junkiesan.github.io/react-chat/)

A small chat application made for fun.

I used the following technologies:
* React
* Chat Engine
* Sass
* Webpack
* Babel
* Github Pages

## Production

The project is hosted on Github Pages, a product that I often use on other small apps.

## Scripts

After forking the project you can start the local Webpack Dev Server (usually on port `8080`):

```bash
yarn start
```

To lint all JavaScript files in the `src` folder:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To build and deploy your app to `gh-pages` branch on the GitHub repo:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
